# iOSTouchVisualizer

This app shows fingers on the screen with circular views under them. It supports multiple fingers on the screen and tracks the fingers as they move around.

To run the app, open `./Example/Example.xcodeproj` and build code onto an iphone device. It should work right out the box after changing the team and resigning the code. To change the number of taps for the uniform filter on the location of the visualizer, change the variable `numTaps` on line 18 in `./TouchVisualizer/Visualizer.swift`
